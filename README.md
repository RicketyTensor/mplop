# MPLOP

Wrapper for matplotlib functionality to allow for easier creation and manipulation of plots.
The design of the wrapper keeps the naming convention of most functions from the matplotlib.
This is to allow a  user to switch between a native matplotlib figures and the mplop figures more easily.
